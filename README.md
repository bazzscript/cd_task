A new Flutter project Task Given to me by my mentor at codeclan coding bootcamp.

## Getting Started

Recreate the Dribbble design from https://dribbble.com/shots/10991972-Covid-19. The first design on the left is what i should implement.
The image i should use is on https://undraw.co/search - i should search for "Sentiment analysis" and use the first image from the search.
